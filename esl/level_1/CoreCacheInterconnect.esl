define component CoreCacheInterconnect
  parameters
    length     is a Length     property
    bandwidth  is a Bandwidth  property
    bus-width  is a BusWidth  property
    latency    is a Latency    property

  design-requirements
    dr-interconnect-bandwidth: bandwidth must be at least 100.0 [GB/s]

  transformation-constraints
    tc-bandwidth:     does convert bus-width into bandwidth
    tc-latency:      does convert bandwidth and length into latency
