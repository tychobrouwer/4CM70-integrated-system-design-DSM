  parameters
    length is a length property
    bandwidth is a bandwidth property
    bus-width is a bus-width property
    latency is a latency property
  
  design-requirements
    dr-interconnect-bandwidth: bandwidth must be at least 100.0 [GB/s]

  transformation-constraints
    tc-length-vs-latency: does convert length into latency
    tc-buswidth-vs-bandwidth: does convert bus-width into bandwidth
